# World Information
The Clock page lets you find the time in a world location as well as compare the time difference between two places.
The Weather page will allow you to see the current weather in a location.
The Currency page will let you find out what currency a country uses or if you know the name of a currency, it will help you find out where it's from.

This is a personal project I have wanted to do since I love random facts about foreign countries!
